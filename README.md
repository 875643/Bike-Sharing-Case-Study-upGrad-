# Bike-Sharing-Case-Study-upGrad-

A bike-sharing system is a service that provides bikes for shared use by individuals on a short-term basis, either for a fee or for free. This allows people to easily access bicycles for transportation without the need for ownership.

Objective

You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 

Methodology

1. Data Sourcing
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
3. Data Visualization
4. Univariate / Bivariate Analysis
5. Feature Engineering
6. Splitting the data into Test and Train dataset
7. Building a Linear Regression model 
8. Evaluating a model by using different metrics
